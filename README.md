### Few words about me:
I consider myself a highly diligent person who has a calling for work in the software industry. I have been enticed by machines from very early on, and a career as a software developer was an obvious choice for me. Few years of professional experience combined with formal education from top-notch universities enabled me to get a broader perspective on the software as a whole and the value of efficient teamwork. On a side note, I am a huge fan of functional programming, especially a declarative approach.

### Things outside of IT of which I am keen on:
🎵 Alternative / Indie Rock\
🏎️ German Sports Cars\
